Readability: Suspend functions make code more readable and maintainable. You can write asynchronous code in a linear fashion, making it easier to understand.

Concurrency: They enable concurrency without the complexity of traditional callback-based or thread-based approaches. Coroutines can be paused and resumed efficiently.

Resource Efficiency: Suspend functions reduce the need for spawning numerous threads, which can be resource-intensive. This makes efficient use of system resources.

Structured Concurrency: Suspend functions fit naturally within the concept of structured concurrency, ensuring that coroutines are launched and canceled in a controlled manner.

When working with suspend functions, consider the following best practices:

Use suspend functions for I/O-bound operations, network requests, file I/O, and database queries, as they prevent blocking the main thread.
Avoid using suspend functions for CPU-bound operations, as they are better suited for non-blocking tasks.
Leverage structured concurrency to manage the lifecycle of coroutines, ensuring they are launched and canceled appropriately.
