Dagger is an open-source, lightweight dependency injection framework from Google. It is designed to help developers write more maintainable and testable code by separating the business logic from the framework code. 
Dagger uses annotation processing to generate the code for you, and it is highly optimized for Android applications. 
One of the main benefits of Dagger is that it allows developers to easily customize the generated code, which makes it very powerful.
However, Dagger is not the most beginner-friendly option and can be complex to set up and use.

Hilt is a dependency injection framework developed by Google. It is based on Dagger, but it simplifies the setup and configuration process. 
Hilt provides a set of components and annotations that make it easier to configure Dagger, and it also provides a set of best practices for structuring your code. 
Hilt is designed to be a more beginner-friendly option, and it can be used in both Android and web applications. 
The downside to Hilt is that it can be more resource-intensive than Dagger, and it is not as customizable.

Koin is an open-source dependency injection framework created by the developers of the Android application, Kotlin. Koin is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and it is optimized for Kotlin applications.
Koin uses a DSL (domain-specific language) to define dependencies, and it provides a rich set of features that make it easy to customize the generated code.
One of the main benefits of Koin is that it is highly optimized for Kotlin applications, which makes it a great choice for developers using the language.
