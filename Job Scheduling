Job Scheduling api, as the name suggests, allows to schedule jobs while letting the system optimize based on memory, power, and connectivity conditions.
The JobScheduler supports batch scheduling of jobs. The Android system can combine jobs so that battery consumption is reduced.
JobManager makes handling uploads easier as it handles automatically the unreliability of the network. It also survives application restarts.

Scenarios:
Tasks that should be done once the device is connect to a power supply
Tasks that require network access or a Wi-Fi connection.
Task that are not critical or user facing
Tasks that should be running on a regular basis as batch where the timing is not critical
